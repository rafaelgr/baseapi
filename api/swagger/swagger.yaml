  title: BASEAPI APP
  version: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    This is a test api that runs with swagger.
    The idea is to build an operational API with all things a developer need
    This file uses almost every single aspect of the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org/).  
    This API will use JSON.  
    JSON looks like this:  
    
    ```JSON
    {
      "key": "value",
      "anotherKey": "anotherValue"
    }
    ```
